# Happy Peg

<a href="http://happypegapp.com">Happy Peg</a> is a remake of the classic peg game found in many restaurants. 
We took that original game and added a few special features, such as: Timers, Continue Game and Hints.

Originally developed as a Flash (iOS packager) app and now being built by PixelBit as a native iOS app.
